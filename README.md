## API Documentation

## Author

My name is **Hamet Kévin E. ODOUTAN** (@vinoskey524). I’ve been doing software development since 8 years now. I do web, desktop, and mobile development, and now I’m very excited to contribute to open-source with forestDB.

I’m not the kind of developer who types “How to build a cool web app” into Google and picks the first response, or the kind who makes a dumb copy-paste from ChatGPT. No !
I like to understand things and know what I’m really doing. For me, a real developer should be able to explain every single line of his code.

Don’t ask me which school or university I attended, because I taught myself software engineering using PDFs from **openclassrooms.com**, which was called **siteduzero** when I started.
A sad truth is that you can’t learn coding just by watching videos; you need books !

I’m really passionate about building software, and **I sincerely believe that being a developer is not just a job, but a lifestyle** !
